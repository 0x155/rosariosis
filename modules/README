Place here the Modules you want to add to RosarioSIS.

Activate them via:
School Setup > School Configuration > Modules

Every plugin must have a Menu.php file.

Note:
The State Reports archive contains a module from Centre/SIS, it is not compatible with RosarioSIS as is.

Note 2:
To create a custom module, or add a program to an existing module, please refer to https://github.com/francoisjacquet/rosariosis-module-example
