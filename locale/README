The /locale folder contains the localization files.
The structure of the subfolders and files must be as follow:
For example, for a french translation:

locale/
	fr_FR.utf8/
		LC_MESSAGES/
			rosariosis.mo
			rosariosis.po
		
Note: "fr_FR.utf8" is the name of the French locale. Do not forget to install the locale first (on Ubuntu):
locale -a
sudo apt-get install language-pack-fr

Note 2: The localization system is gettext, and the *.po files can be edited with the freeware Poedit.
