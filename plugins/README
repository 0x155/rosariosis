Place here the Plugins you want to add to RosarioSIS.

Activate them via:
School Setup > School Configuration > Plugins

Every plugin must have a functions.php file and a config.inc.php file.
The functions.php file contains the functions to be automatically loaded by RosarioSIS.
The config.inc.php file is included by the modules/School_Setup/includes/Plugins.inc.php file when the Configuration link in the plugin listing is clicked.
