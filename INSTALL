Rosario Student Information System - INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.8.12
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Before Installing RosarioSIS, you must read and agree to the included
license.

RosarioSIS is a web based application which relies on other facilities such as
a web server, PHP server-side scripting, and postgres database server.  For
RosarioSIS to work you must first have your web server working, PHP working,
postgres working. username/password authentication working.  Setting these
up varies a lot with platform, operating system, and distribution so it is
well beyond to scope of this brief install document. RosarioSIS was
tested on a Windows 7 x64 with Apache 2.2.21, Postgres 9.1, and PHP 5.3.9 
(EasyPHP 5.3.9) and on a Ubuntu Server 12.04 with Apache 2.2.22, Postgres 9.1, 
and PHP 5.3.10 and through Mozilla Firefox and BrowserStack for cross-browser
compatibility.

Minimum requirements: PHP 5.3.2 & Postgres 8

Installing the Package
----------------------

Unzip the RosarioSIS distribution to a directory that is accessible to your web
browser. Edit the config.inc.sample.php file to set the configuration variables 
as appropriate for your installation. Rename the file to config.inc.php.

  $DatabaseServer is the host name or ip for the database server
  $DatabaseUsername is the username used for authenticating the database
  $DatabasePassword is the password used for authenticating the database
  $DatabaseName is the database name
  $DatabasePort is the socket port number for accessing the database server

  $RosarioPath is full path to RosarioSIS installation, you can define it 
	statically for your installation or the runtime value derived from the 
	__FILE__ magic constant should work
  $pg_dumpPath is full path to the postgres database dump utility pg_dump
  $wkhtmltopdfPath full path to wkhtmltopdf for pdf 'printing'
  
  $DefaultSyear default school year, should be present in the database to 
	be able to login
  $RosarioNotifyAddress is email address to send error and new administrator notifications
  $RosarioLocales is a comma separated list of the locale names of the 
	translations (see locale/ folder for available locales)

  [Optional variables]
  $wkhtmltopdfAssetsPath is path where wkhtmltopdf will access the assets/
	directory, possibly different than how the user's web browser finds it,
	empty string means no translation
  $StudentPicturesPath relative path to student pictures
  $UserPicturesPath relative path to user pictures
  $PortalNotesFilesPath relative path to portal notes attached files
  $FS_IconsPath relative path to food service icons
  $LocalePath relative path were the language packs are stored.
	You need to restart Apache at each change in this directory
  $Timezone sets the default time zone used by all date/time functions.
	See List of Supported Timezones: http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php

Now, you're ready to setup the RosarioSIS database. If you have access to the
command prompt for your server, follow these instructions.  If you're using
phpPGAdmin or a similar tool, import the rosariosis.sql file included in
this package.

	1) Open a command prompt window.
	2) Login as the postgres user
		ex) server$ su - postgres
	3) Login to the postgres database server using the template1 database
		ex) server$ psql template1
	4) Create the rosariosis database
		ex) template1=# CREATE DATABASE rosariosis;
	5) Skip to step 6 if used in an American / English-speaking environment.
			If your data will include non-standard English characters (like
			characters with accent marks), you'll have to create your database
			with a different character encoding (the default is unicode).
			ex) createdb rosariosis -E UTF8
			UTF8 is Unicode, 8-bit -- useful for all languages.
			See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/interactive/multibyte.html for
			more information.
	6) Logout of the database server
		ex) template1=# \q
	7) Run the RosarioSIS sql file
		ex) server$ psql rosariosis < YOUR_ROSARIO_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/rosariosis.sql > rosariosis.log

Notice, you will see several lines beginning "NOTICE:  ALTER TABLE / ADD PRIMARY
KEY will create implicit index " after completing direction 6.  Disregard these
messages.

If you run into permissions problems involving rosariosis.log, simply remove the 
" > rosariosis.log" from the command

You will have to start postgres with the -i option, telling postmaster to accept
TCP/IP connections.  Also, the pg_hba.conf file may have to be altered to specify the
server's TCP/IP address.

That's it!... now, point your browser to:

	http://yourdomain.com/INSTALL_LOCATION/index.php

and login as 'admin' password 'admin'.  With this login, you can create new
users, and change and delete the three template users.  Since students can not
be deleted the template student should be changed to a proper student.
